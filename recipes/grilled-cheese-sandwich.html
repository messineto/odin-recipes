        <h2>Everyone needs to know how to make a classic grilled cheese sandwich</h2>
        <p>This classic grilled cheese sandwich recipe calls for just white bread, sliced cheese, and butter. It's easy to switch up the bread and cheese to suit your taste preferences and, if you like, you can substitute mayonnaise for butter.</p>
        <p>This recipe calls for sliced Cheddar, which is a wonderfully crowd-pleasing cheese. You can use sharp Cheddar, mild Cheddar, or a blend of both. Another classic choice is plain ol' sliced American cheese â€“ it tastes nostalgic and gives you a gorgeous cheese pull.</p>
